# EqualEd

EqualEd is an educational platform dedicated to promoting accessibility for students with disabilities. This project aims to provide a seamless learning experience for all users by ensuring that educational resources and features are inclusive and adhere to accessibility standards.

## Technologies Used

- Ruby on Rails: The backend framework for building the application.
- React.js: The frontend library for creating interactive user interfaces.
- PostgreSQL: The relational database management system for storing data.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Frontend technologies for creating the user interface.
- Bootstrap: A frontend framework for responsive and user-friendly design.
- Devise: A Ruby gem for user authentication.
- Other Ruby gems for database management, validations, and more (customize based on your project's needs).

## AI Integration Features

EqualEd leverages the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance accessibility and provide a more inclusive learning experience. Here are some key AI integration features:

* Auto-Transcription

EqualEd uses AI-driven auto-transcription to provide real-time transcriptions of audio content. This feature benefits students with hearing impairments by ensuring that they can access and understand spoken information.

* Text-to-Speech (TTS)

The Text-to-Speech (TTS) feature converts written text into spoken language. It allows students with visual impairments or reading difficulties to have text-based content read aloud to them, improving their comprehension and engagement.

* AI-Powered Recommendations

Our AI algorithms analyze user behavior and learning preferences to provide personalized content recommendations. This feature helps all students discover relevant resources and tailor their learning experience to their needs.

* Accessibility Audits

EqualEd's AI-driven accessibility audits automatically evaluate learning resources and features for compliance with accessibility standards. This ensures that all content and functionalities meet the highest accessibility criteria.

* Natural Language Processing (NLP)

We employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to assist students in understanding complex textual content. This feature provides definitions, explanations, and contextual information when students encounter challenging concepts.

* Adaptive Learning

The AI-driven adaptive learning feature customizes learning pathways for individual students. It adjusts the difficulty level and content based on each student's progress, ensuring that they receive an optimal learning experience.
